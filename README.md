# AirBnB Clone Project

## Overview
This project is a full-stack clone of the AirBnB platform, created as part of the Software Engineering track at ALX. The goal is to build a robust web application that allows users to list, search, and book vacation rentals, similar to the real AirBnB.

## Objectives
- Understand and implement core backend concepts including data modeling, ORM, RESTful API design, and authentication.
- Build a scalable and responsive frontend that integrates seamlessly with the backend APIs.
- Follow software engineering best practices, including version control, modular design, and clean code.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Python3, Flask/Django (based on project stage)
- **Database**: MySQL or PostgreSQL
- **APIs**: Django REST Framework / Flask RESTful
- **Version Control**: Git & GitHub
- **Deployment**: GitHub Pages / Heroku / Vercel (as applicable)

## Project Structure
This repository will contain:
- All backend logic and database models
- Frontend interface and templates
- API endpoints and integration
- Documentation and feature roadmap
