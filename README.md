- **Backend**: Python3, Flask/Django (based on project stage)
- **Database**: MySQL or PostgreSQL
- **APIs**: Django REST Framework / Flask RESTful
- **Version Control**: Git & GitHub
- **Deployment**: GitHub Pages / Heroku / Vercel (as applicable)

## Project Structure
This repository will contain:
- All backend logic and database models
- Frontend interface and templates
- API endpoints and integration
- Documentation and feature roadmap

## 🖌️ UI/UX Design Planning
